# Spring Boot Demo Project

Welcome to the Spring Boot Demo project! This repository demonstrates a basic Spring Boot application built with Maven and Java.

## Overview
This project is designed as a starting point for building RESTful web applications using Spring Boot. It includes essential dependencies and a simple example controller.

## Key Features
- **Spring Web**: Build REST APIs and web applications easily.
- **Spring Boot DevTools**: Enables hot reloading for faster development.
- **Lombok** (optional): Reduces boilerplate code for Java classes.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd GithubAction
   ```
2. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. **Access the app:**
